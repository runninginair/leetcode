Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of
citations a researcher received for their ith paper and citations is sorted
in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations
each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.


Example 1:
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of
them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the
remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.

Example 2:
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:    n == citations.length
                1 <= n <= 10^5
                0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
                citations is sorted in ascending order.
